## Question 2: Large Language Models (LLMs)

**What are the key characteristics that define Large Language Models (LLMs)?**

A) Small, fast, and cheap  
B) Large, Language-focused, and Mathematical models  
C) Only work with English language  
D) Designed specifically for image generation  

<details>

## Question 3: Real-World AI Applications

**Which of these is NOT mentioned as a real-world Generative AI example in the workshop?**

A) ChatGPT for conversational AI  
B) DALL-E for text-to-image creation  
C) Excel for spreadsheet calculations  
D) GitHub Copilot for code completion  

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Answer: C) Excel for spreadsheet calculations**

**Explanation:** Excel is a traditional software tool, not a Generative AI application. The workshop mentions ChatGPT, DALL-E, and GitHub Copilot as examples of Generative AI tools.
</details>

## Question 4: LLM Client Basics

**According to Part 2 of the workshop, what is the first step to start building with LLMs?**

A) Build an AI agent  
B) Create structured outputs  
C) Connect to an LLM using an API client  
D) Set up tool calling  

<details>

**Answer: C) Connect to an LLM using an API client**

**Explanation:** The workshop progression starts with "Connect to AI (Gemini Client)" as the foundation before moving to structured outputs, tool calling, and AI agents.
</details>

## Question 5: Structured Outputs

**Why are structured outputs important when working with LLMs?**

A) They make the AI run faster  
B) They convert messy text responses into clean, organized data (like JSON)  
C) They reduce the cost of API calls  
D) They are required by law  

<details>

**Answer: B) They convert messy text responses into clean, organized data (like JSON)**

**Explanation:** The workshop shows how structured outputs solve the problem of "messy text" by converting long paragraphs into clean, organized JSON format that's easy to work with programmatically.
</details>

## Question 6: Tool Calling

**What is the main purpose of tool calling in AI applications?**

A) To make the AI think faster  
B) To give AI access to real-world capabilities like checking time, weather, or doing calculations  
C) To reduce the size of the AI model  
D) To make the AI speak different languages  

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Answer: B) To give AI access to real-world capabilities like checking time, weather, or doing calculations**

**Explanation:** Tool calling allows AI to use external functions and tools to perform specific tasks like checking time, calculating math, or getting weather data, extending beyond just text generation.
</details>

## Question 7: AI Agents

**According to the workshop, what are the three key components that make an AI Agent?**

A) Speed, Accuracy, and Cost  
B) Goals, Reasoning, and Actions  
C) Input, Processing, and Output  
D) Training, Testing, and Deployment  

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Answer: B) Goals, Reasoning, and Actions**

**Explanation:** The workshop defines AI agents as having three key components: Goals (knows what to achieve), Reasoning (thinks through steps), and Actions (uses tools to get things done).
</details>

## Question 8: RAG - The Core Problem

**What is the main problem that Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) solves?**

A) Making AI responses faster  
B) Reducing the cost of AI  
C) Giving AI access to specific data it wasn't trained on (like GCES college documents)  
D) Making AI work offline  

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Answer: C) Giving AI access to specific data it wasn't trained on (like GCES college documents)**

**Explanation:** RAG solves the problem that regular AI only knows what it was trained on, not your specific data. The workshop uses GCES college documents as an example of data AI can't naturally access.
</details>

---

## Question 9: RAG Pipeline Steps

**What are the main phases in the RAG pipeline according to the workshop?**

A) Setup Phase (done once) and Query Phase (every question)  
B) Training Phase and Testing Phase  
C) Input Phase and Output Phase  
D) Data Phase and AI Phase  

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Answer: A) Setup Phase (done once) and Query Phase (every question)**

**Explanation:** The RAG pipeline has two main phases: Setup Phase (load documents, chunk, create embeddings, store) done once, and Query Phase (convert question, find similar chunks, AI + found data) done for every question.
</details>

## Question 10: Your Next Steps

**According to Part 4, what is recommended as the best approach for your first AI project?**

A) Build the most complex system possible  
B) Start small with a simple project you can complete in a weekend  
C) Wait until you have more experience  
D) Copy someone else's project exactly  

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Answer: B) Start small with a simple project you can complete in a weekend**

**Explanation:** The workshop emphasizes starting small with projects like a Personal Knowledge Assistant or Smart Email Assistant that can be built in 1-2 hours. The weekend project approach helps you build confidence and get real experience quickly.
