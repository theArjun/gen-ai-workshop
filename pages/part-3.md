# 🔗 Understanding Embeddings

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8">

<div>

## What are Embeddings? 🤔
Mathematical representations of words/concepts as numbers (vectors) that capture meaning and relationships.

## The Magic ✨
- Similar words have similar vectors
- Relationships are preserved mathematically
- Enable semantic understanding

## Example Relationships 📐
- King - Man + Woman = Queen
- Paris - France + Italy = Rome
